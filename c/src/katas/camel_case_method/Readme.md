# Give me C lang code for Camel Case Method (C)

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <ctype.h>

char *camel_case(const char *s)
{
    return NULL;
}

## Description:

Write a method (or function, depending on the language) that converts a string to camelCase, that is, all words must have their first letter capitalized and spaces must be removed.

Examples (input --> output):

"hello case" --> "HelloCase"
"camel case word" --> "CamelCaseWord"

Don't forget to rate this kata! Thanks :)
